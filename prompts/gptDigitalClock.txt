Please reference OCS https://github.com/orff/OpenClockStandard and ahere to the JSON schema: https://github.com/orff/OpenClockStandard/blob/main/schema/schema.json

Notes:
- fontFamily goes inside the textOptions and use scale for the text size, fontSize is not in the schema
- Dont include a line with the schema definition ,EG "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
- the assets node is required, even if its an empty array
- 0.0 is center for verticalPosition and horizontalPosition, not 0.5.  To position and item to the left of center it would be negative
- Valid position number range is -1.0 - 1.0
- good sizes for images are 199 wide and 242 height -- aspect ratio 0.82
- export files using ocs extension, not json

Can you make a simple digital clock with big green numbers and using a "fontFamily" of "Digital-7Mono"
